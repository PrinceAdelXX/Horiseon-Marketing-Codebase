# Horiseon Refactoring Codebase

## Purpose 

Horiseon is a website that's intended for business owners to find the right clients for their business. It monopolises online opinion that clients/users have access to, and auto determines the brands that are feasible to their needs for success. The code is refactored by meeting standards in web accessability, by organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, utilisation of comments or section of the page

The website has three shortcuts:

1. Search Engine Optimization

2. Online Reputation Management

3. Social Media Marketing
